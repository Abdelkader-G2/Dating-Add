# Dating API

A simple dating API built with .NET that allows users to create profiles, browse matches, and interact with other users. This API is designed for use in a dating app or website.

## Features

- **Matching Algorithm**: Basic matching algorithm to find potential matches based on profile data.
- **Messaging**: Secure messaging functionality allowing users to chat with each other.
- **Like and Dislike System**: Ability to like or dislike other profiles, with mutual likes creating a match.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or SignalR-based real-time updates for new messages and match notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core** - Backend framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - Database management
- **SQL Server / PostgreSQL** - Database (adjust based on your choice)
- **JWT** - JSON Web Token for secure user authentication
- **SignalR (optional)** - Real-time communication for chat and notifications
- **Swagger** - API documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
